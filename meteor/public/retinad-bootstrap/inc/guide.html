            <h3>2. Create your app</h3>
            <p>Now, in order to track your analytics, we need to know a bit about your app. If you haven't created an app yet, go in "My Apps" (at the top of the screen) and create a new app by clicking "+". Now, in the app settings you should see 2 keys : “App ID” and “App Secret”. You will need those keys in Unity.</p>

            <h3>3. Open Unity</h3>
            <p>Open Unity and your project’s first scene. Make sure you have imported the VR Headset’s SDK before (I.E: Oculus SDK, Samsung Gear VR SDK, etc). In the menu bar, find “Asset” à “Import Package” à “Custom Package”</p>
