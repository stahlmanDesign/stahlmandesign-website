		            <h3 id="toc_5">Who can access my data? Is it public?</h3>
		            <p>Your data is completely private and confidential. No one but you has access to it. We use the safest security standards available to ensure your protection.</p>

		            <p>We support Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard. Other devices and platforms will be supported soon! If you are targeting a specific platform or device that is not supported, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@retinadvr.com">support@retinadvr.com</a></p>

		            <h3 id="toc_8">What are sessions? How are they counted?</h3>
		            <p>A new session is created every time a user opens your app and interacts with it. The session ends when the user is done using the app. So for example, if your neighbor uses your app twice a day, he will have contributed to 2 new sessions every day.</p>
