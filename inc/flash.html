    <h1>Flash</h1>
    <p>The web is a better place without Flash. But I can't say the same for infographics and games. Multimedia technologies were set back 5-10 years as we artists had to get in the ring and learn how the web <em>really</em> works (or doesn't). It has been frustrating, but were finally seeing SVG support and an explosion of Javascript librairies and data standards like JSON. But these old Flash interactives are still more fun, and were easier to produce than what I do now in HTML5.</p>
